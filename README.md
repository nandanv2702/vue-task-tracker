# Vue TasKer

## Project Description

The aim of this project is for me to learn how to use [VueJs](https://v3.vuejs.org). This is an application wherein a user can enter tasks they'd like to get done by a certain date & time, & can also set a reminder for it. All tasks are stored in localStorage and notifications are sent via the browser (given that the tab is open).
